# AngularJS Employee Directory Web App
### Introduction
This was a simple angular project that was created while attending Full Sail University. The goal was to create a simple employee directory with a form to add new employees and a list of current employees using the AngularJS library. There is a search bar in the navbar that is not functional because it was not included in the scope of the project, but I thought it may be a good idea to add it and eventually come back to it and make it functional.

### Scope
The scope of the project is to create an Angular app that has three functions:
1. Add new employees
2. Delete employees
3. Show the current employees with new employees added

### Styled and Responsive
I used the Bootstrap CSS framework for a responsive design and Font Awesome for super cool icons.

### Functionality
The app.js holds the module MyApp as well as the controller to make the app functional and it takes in the dependancy of the dataService.js file which is where the array of employees and the functions to print, add, and delete reside.
